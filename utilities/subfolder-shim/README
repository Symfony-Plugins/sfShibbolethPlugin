PROBLEM: you want to use Shibboleth to protect only PART of your URL space,
so that you can have non-authenticated interactions with users who
are not yet part of your community.

OBVIOUS SOLUTION: you've tried to set this up with a <Location /shibboleth> 
block that only applies Shibboleth authentication to /shibboleth...

But it doesn't work. The user is forced to log in, but Symfony
never sees REMOTE_USER because Shibboleth is unimpressed by mod_rewrite
and considers the front end controller to not be in /shibboleth. Ahrgh!

CLEVER WORKAROUND: a real /shibboleth folder with a simple index.php script 
that just requires the real front end controller from the parent folder... 
after setting $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] and $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] to the URL of 
the sfShibbolethAuth/login action and scrubbing all references to
/shibboleth, /shibboleth/ and /shibboleth/index.php from the 
$_SERVER variables. When the sfShibbolethAuth/login action sees a good 
REMOTE_USER environment variable, it redirects away immediately, 
so the various potential problems of running the front end controller 
from the "wrong" folder are nonissues for us.

Sure, it's ugly, but it works great. At least until someone finds a way
to make the original, elegant, Apache conf-based solution work.

HOW TO INSTALL: copy this folder to the subfolder of your web folder
that matches the path you are protecting directly with Shibboleth.
Then, in your web/.htaccess file, exempt that folder from the
usual mod_rewrite rules like so:

    # We skip the shibboleth shim script folder
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/shibboleth
    RewriteRule .* - [L]

Install these new rules AFTER these existing rules:

    # we skip all files with .something, except .html
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \..+$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$
    RewriteRule .* - [L]

Then set the following in app.yml so that sfShibbolethPlugin will
know to redirect users who are ready to authenticate to the special 
controller in the shibbolized folder (substitute the folder you
are directly shibbolizing if it's not /shibboleth):

prod:
  sfShibboleth:
    shim: "https://yoursite/shibboleth"

Finally, change the redirect URL in the shim folder's index.php
script to point wherever YOUR routing rules have put sfShibbolethAuth/login.
With pkContextCMS it's typically /cms/sfShibbolethAuth/login. With
no special routing rules in effect it'll be /sfShibbolethAuth/login.
